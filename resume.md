Experience
----------

#### Dropbox (May 2014 - March 2017)

##### Software Engineer - Metaserver Platform Team

Responsible for making server application engineering easy, fast, and safe.

- Led an initiative to unify the test and development environments for all parts
  of the server codebase, including integration environments requiring
  microservices to coordinate with each other
- Implemented per-route alerting for all Python endpoints
- Described the consistency implications of Dropbox's database access patterns,
  and produced recommendations for changing them
- Worked with the team responsible for Dropbox's custom database to define and
  implement APIs for data access with clear, well-defined consistency semantics
- Participated in the rotation responsible for deploying code to the majority of
  Dropbox's application-level servers

##### Software Engineer - Filesystems

- Helped port core Dropbox filesystem code from Python to Go
- Led recovery and reconstruction from data storage inconsistencies
- Participated in Dropbox's catchall server on-call rotation

##### Miscellaneous 

- Contributor to [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy), a static typechecker 
  for Python, with a focus on making function types flexible and exact

#### Meteor Development Group (November 2012 - February 2014)

##### Core Developer

Worked on a live-updating JavaScript web application framework and a hosting
environment designed to work with it.

- Created key parts of an application hosting environment for Meteor apps,
  including a distributed scheduler
- Designed and implemented automatic updating of the hosting environment across
  multiple machines, avoiding downtime in hosted applications
- Implemented update logic for hosted Meteor applications, also
  without downtime
- Wrote an automated testing server, with a web front-end that allows users to
  easily see differences in test results between runs
- Co-wrote the DDP (Meteor's data and RPC protocol) version pre-1 specification
  and implemented many of the necessary framework features to support it
- In an on-call rotation, fixed operational problems with the hosting
  environment and the MongoDB deployment it depends on

#### StreamBase Systems (now TIBCO) (July 2007 - November 2012)

##### Senior Software Engineer, Runtime Group

Designed and implemented programming language features for StreamBase StreamSQL
EventFlow, a stream-relational programming language for event-driven systems
that compiles to JVM bytecode.

- Led language evolution efforts, including requirements gathering from field
  engineers, as well as defining, implementing, and refining language features
- Designed and implemented Capture Fields, a modularity feature specifically
  useful in EventFlow and similar languages
- Implemented functions as a first-class data type in EventFlow
- Decreased latency for EventFlow programs by improving the runtime environment
- Developed and communicated best practices for software engineers using EventFlow
- Wrote frameworks in EventFlow for automating securities trading tasks

Languages
------

As a polyglot programmer, I learn new languages and tools quickly.  At any given
time I have about three programming languages in main memory, with quite a few
more swapped to disk. Right now I have Python, Go, and some Scala paged in.
