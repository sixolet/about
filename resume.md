Experience
----------

#### Meteor Development Group (November 2012 - February 2014)

##### Core Developer

Worked on a live-updating JavaScript web application framework and a hosting
environment designed to work with it.

- Created key parts of an application hosting environment for Meteor apps,
  including a distributed scheduler
- Designed and implemented automatic updating of the hosting environment across
  multiple machines, avoiding downtime in hosted applications
- Implemented update logic for hosted Meteor applications, also
  without downtime
- Wrote an automated testing server, with a web front-end that allows users to
  easily see differences in test results between runs
- Co-wrote the DDP (Meteor's data and RPC protocol) version pre-1 specification
  and implemented many of the necessary framework features to support it

#### StreamBase Systems (now TIBCO) (July 2007 - November 2012)

##### Senior Software Engineer, Runtime Group

Designed and implemented programming language features for StreamBase StreamSQL
EventFlow, a stream-relational programming language for event-driven systems.

- Led language evolution efforts, including requirements gathering from field
  engineers, as well as defining, implementing, and refining language features
- Designed and implemented Capture Fields, a modularity feature specifically
  useful in EventFlow and similar languages
- Implemented functions as a first-class data type in EventFlow
- Decreased latency for EventFlow programs by improving the runtime environment
- Developed and communicated best practices for software engineers using EventFlow
- Wrote frameworks in EventFlow for automating securities trading tasks

Languages
------

As a polyglot programmer, I learn new languages and tools quickly.  At any given
time, I have about three programming languages in main memory, with quite a few
more swapped to disk. Right now I have JavaScript (underscore.js variant),
Python, and Java paged in.
